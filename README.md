#### Video Demo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqMTOhxm3qY
#### Description:

1) For this project I deceided to try for the first time doing a small 2D game. My goal was to create a fully functionnal game 
that is scalable. So that if I want, I can easily add new maps, monster, addon etc. without changing the base code of the game. I also
wanted to touch to everything related to 2d Game: Audio, Animation, Game Over, Welcome Sccreen, Points, HD save, movement, monsters, etc

2) Here a quick list of the tasks I had to do:
TASK to create the game
- Create Player
- Map Keyboard
- Create player movement
- Limit Player movement
- Create bullet list
- Shoot gun 1 directions
- Shoot gun 4 directions
- Shoot gun 8 directions
- Create Monster list
- Create Zombie
- Move Zombie to player
- Check for bullet colision with monster
- Check for collision between player and monster 
- Kill zombie after 2 hit
- Span Zombie at Random
- Span Zombie with a spanTimer that reduce at every span until a minimum of 0.4
- Create end Game, 
- Record score in file (user/appdata/HS)
- Created conf.lua file with identity
- Create welcome screen with high score
- Create Skeleton
- Add background sound
- Add sound effects
- Correct scoring for each kind of monsters
- Draw basic animation from a sprite sheet
- Using map array to generate maps

3) Game structure:
- libs
- sounds
- imgs
- base file

4) I think I archived my goal, I can easily add, new animation, new maps, new monsters without having to change the base code.
Took 22 hours to code, and was a blast to do. I tried my best to comments my codes so it can be easily read in the futur.
